# AMRcast 
## WARNING! This work is still under development 
Command line workflow to predict AMR phenotype.
I would advise checking the sourmash output file to ensure the genome is sufficiently similar to the training data to make an accurate prediction.

Due to file sizes of the Sourmash DBs for each model, please download the files from the following link on the Open Science Framework:

Download eggNOG DBs using the instructions on their GitHub: https://github.com/eggnogdb/eggnog-mapper/ 

If you have any ideas to improve, please report a suggestion.
